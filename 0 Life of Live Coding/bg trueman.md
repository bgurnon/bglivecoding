# Trueman Response

Prior to reading the piece, I didn't really know anything about laptop orchestras, but these are some of the aspects I found most interesting.

It is really interesting thinking about how much the problem of "overplaying" translates to laptop orchestras especially, but really all computer music. The way Trueman describes computers as generating "enormous amounts of sound" stuck with me because to me, it really sums up the power of even a single laptopist.

Trueman's bit about taking care when using automation or generative systems is really interesting. I really liked his point about how if challenge and difficulty aren't viewed as important instrumental virtues, we will miss out on a whole world of possibility. I also appreciate that he acknowledges the extreme selectivity of traditional orchestras, and that there is no need to incorporate that type of gatekeeping into laptop orchestras.

This article is giving me a whole new perspective of musical performance. The idea of using text to communicate during a performance is almost novel, but also a natural mode of communication in a collaborative laptop performance. I think there's something beautiful about how laptop orchestras are creating a new tradition inspired by an impossibly old musical institution, without being encumbered by tradition.

The lack of an inherent physical performance in creating music with a laptop is a really interesting aspect, it makes sense that viewers may struggle to engage when there isn't that physical visual cue that relates to the sound of the performance. This idea of having to actively consider audience engagement ties back to the bit about automation and virtuosity.

Actually, something I did know and personally relate to was the idea that concert band or other large musical groups have some some kind of magic. I played a lot of concert snare and timpani in middle school and high school, and I never cared much at all about the pieces we were playing; it was more about the making sound in a room with 100 people every day.
