For my final performance I plan to live perform a ~ 5-minute house set inspired by tracks like ("100 reasons")[https://youtu.be/PPp3TnYBt9c] by kemt and ("cpu100")[https://youtu.be/fI_N-mdKNwk] by Louke Man. From here, I plan to refine the sounds some more, and then add elements like bass, more percussion, and an arpeggio. Depending on how much time I can spend preparing the set, I would love to add some sort of turnaround/chord change.
