Week 3

MiniTidal Patch 

stack [ s "[bd? bd*2] [bd ~ bd? bd? ~] ~ [bd? bd bd?]",
s "~ cp ~ [cp/3 cp?]",
s "~ ~ ~ [ht ht]/4 ~ ~ ~ [lt lt lt?]/5",
s "{hh*4, hh*6}*2?" ]

I struggled for a bit finding a balance between the patch being too orderly and predictable or noisy and uncoordinated (in a not so nice way) before getting here.

The first layer breaks up the cycle into 4 pulses that move between straight, quintuplet, and triplet feels. I used a lot of ? on individual bass drum hits, especially the downbeats. The second layer adds claps and uses /3 and ? to keep things interesting. Layer 3 adds toms with some triplet low toms, with the first two hitting everything 5 cycles but the third hit randomized. The last layer is a busy hi hat pattern, but the hits play randomly because of a ? at the end.

I mostly ran into syntax errors due to forgetting commas or quotations. I got some other errors like Parse error: EOF, but I was bad and didn't pay attention to what I was doing when it happened. I looked it up and didn't find anything and moved on before remembering I should document it.
