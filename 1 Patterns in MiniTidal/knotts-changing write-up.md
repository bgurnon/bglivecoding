### Knott's Changing Music's Constitution Write-up

Something new:

#Occupy is something I've only really heard of but didn't know it was so focused on anti-hierarchical resistance.

It's so cool how much the LAMC was considering hierarchy and power dynamics when designing the first systems for network music.

Something knew:

Long before consciously thinking about it, I never liked concert band very much other than for hitting drums instead of being in real class. Even though I loved my band director, something about the rigid hierarchy and need for conformity or submission was always off-putting, at least subconsciously.

I never listened to much music by string quartets, but I remember learning that they don't perform with a conductor and being kind of shocked by that since outside of piano compositions, conductors seem so foundational to classical music.
