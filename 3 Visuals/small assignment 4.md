## small assignment 4

For my presentation I would love to research the history and culture of algorave. It's something I don't know a tremendous about, but it seems to be an extension of the generative based/inspired rave music being made by artists like Aphex Twin and Autechre in the 90s, which I like.

The topic may be a bit broad but I'd love to talk about something at least in the realm of algorave! Hypothetically I would spend some time talking about the historical context but focus more on the practices of algorave and important figures like Alex McClean.
