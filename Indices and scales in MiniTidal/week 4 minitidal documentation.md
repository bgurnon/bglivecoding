### MiniTidal Documentation

My first layer is testing out the samples from the industrial soundbank in sequence, and I got a syntax error because I forgot I need two sets of quotations around both the soundbank and the index numbers. I made a lot of similar errors where I just forgot what did what.

I have five layers in the patch. Layer 1 is a sequence of the industrial soundbank, and the second is a big techno kick playing 4. Layer 3 randomly adds a kick to the and-of-1 along with some occasional hi hats. Layer 4 is a sequence of reverse vocals from the "rave" soundbank, and the last layer is a converging double-time arpeggio going between two chords.
