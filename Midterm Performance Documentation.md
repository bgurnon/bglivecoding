## Midterm Performance Documentation

This is the initial Hydra patch I used in the midterm performance with Moms-Against-Vaping:

`osc().thresh(0.99).modulate(noise(10)).color(0.4, 0.5, 0.5)
.add(osc().thresh(0.99).modulate(noise(80)).color(0.7, 1, 1).brightness(0.2))
.rotate(0, 0.2)
.blend(o0, 0.8)
.kaleid(1.8)
.add(shape(4, 0.2).modulate(osc(10)))
.modulate(o0, 0.1)
.diff(osc().thresh(0.99).modulate(noise(20)))
.out(o0)`

Throughout the performance, I changed various parameters to create variation and made some structural changes like using pixelate() in various places, getting rid of kaleid(), and adding repeat() to the shape layer.

In regards to our group dynamic and the overall performance, I feel I got a little too absorbed in what I was doing and wasn't processing the details of the musical performance as well as I could have. This is in part because I had to scramble to get situated mid-performance, but both myself and the group overall didn't really plan out a "plot" for our set and didn't have sections prepared. There were a number of ideas/sounds that kept reoccurring in our rehearsals so it wasn't fully "loose" but I think the performance would have felt more focused and intentional if we prepared more material. For me specifically, in the future I will start my Hydra sets from a simpler place because dynamically speaking, I feel I started high and had to make lateral changes instead of starting low and building energy through the set.

We spent a lot of time trying to come up with a gimmick like switching roles clockwise every minute instead of getting actual material to use through the performance. We eventually bailed on those ideas because as a group we came to the conclusion that switching would probably interrupt the flow in a negative way, and I think this was the correct move. I think we made some cool sounds with cool visuals to match and am happy with the performance overall, but in the future I will definitely be thinking about concrete ways of preparing a set.
